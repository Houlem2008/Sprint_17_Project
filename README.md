# Sprint_17_Project

*My Final Project; like the previous integrated projects there weren't extensive lessons in this sprint, rather the project was utilizing numerous techniques and knowledge from previous lessons. Becaause I scored 6 SP with the main project, no additional assignment was required. Sprint length was 2 weeks.*

# Final Sprint Structure

In the final sprint, you will apply everything you've learned during a two-week bootcamp that simulates work in a real company. You'll be given several tasks, and members of the Student Guidance Team will be helping you complete them. They're going to be your colleagues for the next 14 days.

### Colleagues

- The **team leader** will be giving you tasks and making sure you complete them successfully
- The **project reviewer** will review your code. They are independent experts from another department who work in machine learning, but they don't know the details of the task

### Tasks

To complete the final sprint successfully, you'll need a score of five story points (SP). These are conventional units for measuring the task's difficulty. You'll get:

- 4 to 6 SP for the main project
- 1 SP for the additional assignment

You're going to build a prototype of a machine learning model following these instructions:

1. **Make a work plan**. When you first see the task, you'll notice that it's incomplete and contains unnecessary information. Perform exploratory data analysis to figure out which questions you need to ask.
2. **Investigate the task**. Ask your team leader any questions you may have.
3. **Develop a model**. Submit your code to the project reviewer.
4. **Prepare a report**. Send the report to your team leader so that they can make sure you've completed the tasks correctly.

The final score depends on the quality of your model.

The additional assignment is based on the same data as the main project.

At the end of the sprint, your code will be reviewed by the team leader.

In the video below, our tutor, Anthony, will guide you through the steps and expectations for your work.

# Final Project: Work Plan

You're going to have to preform an exploratory data analysis. At the end of Jupyter Notebook, write:

- A list of clarifying questions
- A rough plan for solving the task, specifying 3-5 basic steps and explaining each step in one or two sentences

The team leader will check your questions and work plan. The code will be reviewed by the team leader only if there are some areas of doubt.

# Final Project: Solution Code

Upload the code of your solution.

Here are some of the criteria used by the project reviewers:
- Have you performed all the steps?
- Does the solution match the task condition?
- Have you trained and tested the model correctly?
- What is the quality score of the best model?
- Have you kept to the project structure?
- Have you kept the code neat?

# Final Project: Solution Report

Make a report at the end of the Jupyter Notebook with the solution. The team leader will check it. The code will be reviewed by the team leader only if there are some points of doubt.

In the report, please answer the following questions:
- What steps of the plan were performed and what steps were skipped (explain why)?
- What difficulties did you encounter and how did you manage to solve them?
- What were some of the key steps to solving the task?
- What is your final model and what quality score does it have?

Here are some of the criteria used by the team leader:
- Did you answer all the questions?
- Are the answers clear?
